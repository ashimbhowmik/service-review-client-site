                Difference between SQL and NoSQL?

                SQL is the programming language used to interface with
                relational databases. Relational databases model data as records
                in rows and tables with logical links between them. NoSQL is a
                class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use
                SQL. <br />
                There are five practical differences between SQL and NoSQL:
                1.Language <br />
                2.Scalability <br />
                3.Structure <br />

                What is JWT, and how does it work?
              </summary>
              <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 text-gray-600">
                SON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely
                transmitting information between parties as JSON object. It is
                compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a
                public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity
                and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties
                involved. The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to
                ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded,
                not encrypted. JWT is a token based stateless authentication
                mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session,
                server doesn't have to completely rely on a datastore(database)
                to save session information.

                What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?
              </summary>
              <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 text-gray-600">
                1. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that is
                lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted. Both Java and HTML
                include it. Node.js, on the other hand, is a V8-based
                server-side programming language. As a result, it is used to
                create network-centric applications. It's a networked system
                made for data-intensive real-time applications. If we compare
                node js vs. python, it is clear that node js will always be the
                preferred option. 2. JavaScript is a simple programming language
                that can be used with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine
                installed. Node.js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or
                execution environment for the JavaScript programming language.
                It requires libraries that can be conveniently accessed from
                JavaScript programming to be more helpful. 3. Any engine may run
                JavaScript. As a result, writing JavaScript is incredibly easy,
                and any working environment is similar to a complete browser.
                Node.js, on the other hand, only enables the V8 engine. Written
                JavaScript code, on the other hand, can run in any context,
                regardless of whether the V8 engine is supported. 4. A specific
                non-blocking operation is required to access any operating
                system. There are a few essential objects in JavaScript, but
                they are entirely OS-specific. Node.js, on the other hand, can
                now operate non-blocking software tasks out of any JavaScript
                programming. It contains no OS-specific constants. Node.js
                establishes a strong relationship with the system files,
                allowing companies to read and write to the hard drive. 5. The
                critical benefits of JavaScript include a wide choice of
                interfaces and interactions and just the proper amount of server
                contact and direct visitor input. Node.js, on the other hand,
                offers node package management with over 500 modules and the
                capacity to handle many requests at the same time. It also
                offers the unique ability to enable microservice architecture
                and the Internet of Things. Even when comparing node js vs.
                react js, node js always wins.{" "}

                Given a NodeJS application, since Node is single threaded, say
                if processing involves a Promise.all that takes 8 seconds, does
                this mean that the client request that comes after this request
                would need to wait for eight seconds? No. NodeJS event loop is
                single threaded. The entire server architecture for NodeJS is
                not single threaded. Before getting into the Node server
                architecture, to take a look at typical multithreaded request
                response model, the web server would have multiple threads and
                when concurrent requests get to the webserver, the webserver
                picks threadOne from the threadPool and threadOne processes
                requestOne and responds to clientOne and when the second request
                comes in, the web server picks up the second thread from the
                threadPool and picks up requestTwo and processes it and responds
                to clientTwo. threadOne is responsible for all kinds of
                operations that requestOne demanded including doing any blocking
                IO operations. The fact that the thread needs to wait for
                blocking IO operations is what makes it inefficient. With this
                kind of a model, the webserver is only able to serve as much
                requests as there are threads in the thread pool.
